TranscendAI is on the path to AGI.</br>
</br>
10 multivariate multithreaded C# optimizers. MIT licensed. No dependencies. No compiled code included.</br>
Adam, RMSprop, Adagrad, Momentum, Nesterov Accelerated Gradient, Genetic, Simulated Annealing, Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (SPSA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Bayesian Optimization</br>
</br>
My Raven code generation system is in beta. Raven is designed to solve more complex problems than can be solved with a single query to an LLM by making many queries to the LLM. I've uploaded some examples of what it can do to this repository.</br>
</br>
Here are some cost comparisons for coding by hand, copying and pasting code from ChatGPT, and with Raven. Raven can accept a specification and will write the code, debug, compile, unit test, and will attempt to keep working on the project until the unit testing can produce a report indicating success. Spec=>unit test report. One click. It can only accomplish fairly small C# projects at this point. I'll be upgrading it to work on larger projects as time goes on.</br>
</br>
I got my code generation system to attempt to build the ten optimizers above. I requested multithreaded multivariate optimizers in C#. It successfully wrote 8 of them, complete with unit tests. The system completed all 8 of those to the point where the unit tests produced a report that indicated successful operation.</br>
</br>
ChatGPT's quotes are pretty high so here are the lower end of the spectrum quotes.</br>
Human hand coded:5.5hrs/optimizer=>44hrs*$50/hr=$2200.</br>
Human copying and pasting from ChatGPT:2.75hrs/optimizer=>22hrs*$50/hr=$1100.</br>
</br>
Me using my Raven code generation system.</br>
Total development time=1 hr and 47 minutes=13.37 minutes/optimizer</br>
1.7833hrs*$50hr=$89.16 human labor cost.</br>
Raven spent $9.26 on AI services from OpenAI's API.</br>
Me and Raven=$89.16+$9.26=$98.42</br>
</br>
I'm not actually interested in working for $50/hr at this point, that's an example quote for a human operator/coder if Raven gets put into production.</br>
</br>
Raven won't do everything a C# coder needs to do. It will do part of a coder's job much faster and cheaper, which will generally increase efficiency. If Raven can perform 25% of a coders job at 1/10 cost then the new cost will be 77.5% of the old cost. This calculation is a guesstimate, how much of a coders job involves writing small reusable libraries depends on the coders job. Coders who spend much of their time writing small reusable libraries will likely be more interested.</br>
</br>
I suspect companies who employ many C# coders might be interested in Raven.</br>
</br>
Footnote: I upgraded Raven to complete larger projects and it completed the Bayesian and Simulated Annealing optimizers so I've uploaded those too.</br>
